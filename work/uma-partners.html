                <p>I realize now the yellow headlines were a bad choice.</p>
                <p>But the banner image of the grad in a circle breaking the plane is a nice treatment of a stock image.</p>
                <p>And the floating grad caps are a nice, subtle touch.</p>
                <p>Generally, not a bad one-pager.</p>

                <p>The tricky bit here was to make a site with not much content or imagery seem exciting. Or, at least not boring.</p>
                <p>The homepage video gives some movement and disguises an undefined brand identity. Bright colors and interesting imagery on the programming touts try to enliven arcane, technical programming.</p>
                <p>The profile pictures were wildly different, so we went black and white for some consistency and authority. This site won't win any awards, but it's a good example of making the best of what you have.</p>
