	    	<p>Sharp League was an online wagering game that combined elements of fantasy sports and gambling into a tournament that you could play with your friends. It was my hobby project for five years, a source of great pride and fun, and also the reason for many long nights spent staring at code with the lights low to not awake the sleeping house.</p>

	    	<p>I am sometimes asked: How do I learn to program? My answer is always: just start something. Take an idea and try to realize it online. Make a website from scratch. It matters little what languages and frameworks you use &mdash; they all will get you there. You will learn so much by just doing it.</p> 

	    	<p>Sharp League, at its height, had hundreds of players. This is not a huge number, but it was significant enough that I had to consider issues of scaling, automation, and community management. As the site got bigger, I got better as a programmer. Starting small was a blessing. The impetus to just "get it to work" was strong, and having live users was proper motivation.</p>

	    	<p>Although I hadn't read "The Lean Startup" at the time, we were certainly practicing the build-measure-learn feedback loop. Most good, new ideas came from the community -- either directly through feature requests or indirectly by paying attention to the message boards. There wasn't much research; it was more: try something, see if it works, ditch the failures quickly, while building on teh successes.</p>

	    	<p>Sharp League taught me how to be a proper programmer by forcing me to solve problems in real situations with immediate impact. The list of things I learned include:</p>
	    	<ul>
	    		<li>Object Oriented Programming - to better structure and resue code.</li>
	    		<li>Model-View-Controller - to seperate concerns and make logic more explicit.</li>
	    		<li>SQL Optimization - to speed up queries and travrse over large datasets.</li>
	    		<li>Server Management - to just keep the damn site up and be aware or potential issues.</li>
	    		<li>



	    	<p>Sharp League also taught me how to be a better UX designer by considering how to get players to take the actions that would enrich the gameplay for the community.
